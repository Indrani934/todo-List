   - A **to-do list** is a list of tasks you need to complete or things you want to do.
   - Typically, tasks are organized in order of priority.
   - Traditionally, people wrote their to-do lists on paper or sticky notes as a memory aid.

     - Excel spreadsheets
     - Word documents
     - Email lists
     - To-do list apps (such as Microsoft To Do, Google Tasks, and others)¹².

2. **Benefits of Using a To-Do List**:
   - **Organization**: When you write down all your tasks in a list, they become more manageable. Having a clear outline helps you stay focused.
   - **Memory Aid**: A to-do list acts as an external memory aid. It allows you to keep track of everything you need to do.
   - **Productivity**: Prioritizing tasks ensures that you focus on what's most important. You won't waste time on less critical tasks.
   - **Sense of Achievement**: Crossing off completed tasks gives you a sense of progress and motivates you to keep moving forward.
